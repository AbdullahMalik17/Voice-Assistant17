# Checklist Creation for Agentic AI Improvements

## Prompt
$ARGUMENTS

## Response
I've created a comprehensive checklist for the agentic AI improvements to the voice assistant project. The checklist focuses on testing the quality of requirements rather than implementation details.

Checklist Details:
- File: F:\Voice_Assistant\specs\002-agentic-ai-improvements\checklists\agentic-ai.md
- Focus: Agentic AI Improvements requirements quality
- Items: 58 checklist items across 8 categories
- Purpose: Validate completeness, clarity, consistency, and coverage of requirements

Focus Areas Covered:
1. Requirement Completeness (10 items)
2. Requirement Clarity (8 items)
3. Requirement Consistency (5 items)
4. Acceptance Criteria Quality (5 items)
5. Scenario Coverage (7 items)
6. Edge Case Coverage (6 items)
7. Non-Functional Requirements (5 items)
8. Dependencies & Assumptions (4 items) plus Ambiguities & Conflicts (4 items) and Traceability (3 items)

The checklist evaluates whether the requirements in your spec are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation. Each item follows the "Unit Tests for English" approach, testing the requirements themselves rather than implementation behavior.
